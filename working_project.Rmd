## Content: 

The data used in this project is of animal sightings on the trail cameras around the Duke forest and the spatial data of the Duke forest;it was collected as part of an ongoing project monitoring the white-tail deer population.

## Hypotheses: 

1. Hypothesis 1:
    - H0: The time of day does not have an impact on observed deer
    - Ha: The time of day being dawn/dusk results in an increase of observed deer

2. Hypothesis 2:
    - H0: Development has no impact on observed deer
    - Ha: An increase in development results in a decrease of observed deer
    
3. Hypothesis 3:
    - H0: The phase of the moon has no impact on observed deer
    - Ha: The moon being full/gibbous results in an increase of observed deer

4. Hypothesis 4:
    - H0: The phase of the moon has no effect on the time of day deer are observed
    - Ha: The moon being full/gibbous results in an increase of observed deer at dawn/dusk


## Background: 

To conduct a deer survey with trail cameras, one camera must be placed every 160 or so acres. (Source: Thomas Jr., L. (2012, April 19). How to run a trail-camera survey. Quality Deer Management Association.)
The Duke forest is 7,000 acres.(Source: Duke University. (n.d.). Duke Forest â€“ Teaching and Research Laboratory. Retrieved from https://dukeforest.duke.edu)
There are 30 trail cameras in the Duke forest along known migration paths.

### ANOVA Tests

```{r ANOVA, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
#testing hypothesis one - time of day has no effect on deer observations
time.one.way <- aov(group_size ~ TOD, data = deer_data)
summary(time.one.way)

#testing hypothesis three - moon phase has no impact on deer observations
moon.one.way <- aov(group_size ~ moon_phase, data = deer_data)
summary(moon.one.way)
#small F-value and large p-value so there is little to suggest that the moon phase influences deer observations

#moon and time test
moon.and.time <- aov(group_size ~ TOD + moon_phase, data = deer_data)
summary(moon.and.time)
#no significance found

#interaction test
moon.time <- aov(group_size ~ TOD*moon_phase, data = deer_data)
summary(moon.time)
#The results indicate a statistically significant main effect of TOD on the response variable. However, there is no significant main effect of moon_phase and no significant interaction effect between TOD and moon_phase. 

#maybe the division locations are adding a block?
moon.time.block <- aov(group_size ~ TOD*moon_phase + division, data = deer_data)
summary(moon.time.block)
#low sum of squares and high p means the block is adding little information to our analysis - not relevant

```
The one-way ANOVA (Analysis of Variance) results **suggest that there is a statistically significant difference among the means of the groups defined by the variable `TOD` (Time of Day).** Here's how to interpret the output:

1. **Df (Degrees of Freedom):** This indicates the degrees of freedom associated with the groups and residuals.
   - For `TOD`: 2 degrees of freedom.
   - For `Residuals`: 800 degrees of freedom.

2. **Sum Sq (Sum of Squares):** This is a measure of the total variability in the data.
   - For `TOD`: 3.7
   - For `Residuals`: 379.4

3. **Mean Sq (Mean Sum of Squares):** This is obtained by dividing the Sum of Squares by its corresponding degrees of freedom.
   - For `TOD`: 1.8634
   - For `Residuals`: 0.4742

4. **F value (F-statistic):** This is the ratio of the variance among group means to the variance within the groups. It is calculated as the Mean Square for `TOD` divided by the Mean Square for `Residuals`.
   - In this case, the F value is 3.929.

5. **Pr(>F) (p-value):** This is the probability of obtaining an F-statistic as extreme as, or more extreme than, the one observed in the data, assuming the null hypothesis is true.
   - In this case, the p-value is 0.02, which is less than the commonly used significance level of 0.05.

**Interpretation:**
The p-value (Pr(>F)) is less than 0.05, indicating that there is **evidence to reject the null hypothesis.** Therefore, there is a statistically significant difference in means among the groups defined by `TOD`. However, the specific interpretation of which groups are different would require further post-hoc tests or examination of the group means.

It's also worth noting that the effect size and the context of our study should be considered when interpreting the practical significance of the results.

### Determining the Best ANOVA Model
```{r Best Model}
model.set <- list(time.one.way, moon.and.time, moon.time, moon.time.block)
model.names <- c("one.way", "two.way", "interaction", "blocking")
aictab(model.set, modnames = model.names)
#based on the AIC, the one-way ANVOA test is the best model. The one.way test has 95% of the AIC weight - meaning it explains 95% of the total variation in the dependent variable (group_size)
plot(time.one.way)

tukey.one.way <- TukeyHSD(time.one.way)
tukey.one.way
plot(tukey.one.way, las = 1)
```
The results of the Tukey Honest Significant Difference (HSD) test provide insights into the pairwise differences between the levels of the `TOD` variable (Time of Day) with respect to the `group_size` variable. Let's break down the output:

1. **diff:** This column represents the differences in means between the levels of `TOD`.

2. **lwr and upr:** These columns indicate the lower and upper bounds of the 95% confidence interval for the differences. If this interval includes zero, the difference is not considered statistically significant.

3. **p adj (adjusted p-value):** This column shows the adjusted p-values after correcting for multiple comparisons.

Now, let's interpret the results for each pairwise comparison:

- **morning vs. day:**
  - Difference: 0.09096293
  - 95% Confidence Interval: [-0.0441878, 0.22611366]
  - p-value: 0.2547153
  - Interpretation: The difference is not statistically significant as the confidence interval includes zero, and the p-value is greater than 0.05.

- **night vs. day:**
  - Difference: -0.07540230
  - 95% Confidence Interval: [-0.2225017, 0.07169713]
  - p-value: 0.4513530
  - Interpretation: The difference is not statistically significant as the confidence interval includes zero, and the p-value is greater than 0.05.

- **night vs. morning:**
  - Difference: -0.16636523
  - 95% Confidence Interval: [-0.3073211, -0.02540937]
  - p-value: 0.0157434
  - Interpretation: The difference is statistically significant as the confidence interval does not include zero, and the p-value is less than 0.05. Therefore, there is evidence to suggest a significant difference in `group_size` between night and morning.

In summary, the Tukey HSD test **suggests that the `group_size` differs significantly between night and morning, while there is no significant difference between morning and day or night and day.** Keep in mind that the interpretation of p-values depends on the chosen significance level (commonly 0.05), and adjustments may be made for multiple comparisons.
