Hypothesis:

This research focused on the intricate dynamics of white-tailed deer movements within Duke Forest, particularly in relation to the time of day and the position of the moon. The objective was to ascertain the impact of these environmental factors on the spatial behavior of deer populations. Additionally, the study aimed to measure the frequency of deer visits to various areas of the forest, with a specific emphasis on understanding how these patterns correlate with nearby developmental activities. This approach provided valuable insights into the adaptability and movement patterns of white-tailed deer in response to anthropogenic changes in their habitat. The methodology and findings of this study offer a significant contribution to the understanding of wildlife ecology, particularly in areas experiencing urban development (Oleniacz).

1. Hypothesis 1:
    - H0: The time of day does not have an impact on observed deer
    - Ha: The time of day being dawn/dusk results in an increase of observed deer

2. Hypothesis 2:
    - H0: Development has no impact on observed deer
    - Ha: An increase in development results in a decrease of observed deer
    
3. Hypothesis 3:
    - H0: The phase of the moon has no impact on observed deer
    - Ha: The moon being full/gibbous results in an increase of observed deer

4. Hypothesis 4:
    - H0: The phase of the moon has no effect on the time of day deer are observed
    - Ha: The moon being full/gibbous results in an increase of observed deer at dawn/dusk

# Dataset Information

In this study, data collection was facilitated through the utilization of trail cameras strategically positioned within Duke Forest, a 7,000-acre research and teaching laboratory managed by Duke University (Duke University, n.d.). Under the guidance of Dr. Roberts' laboratory, known for its expertise in monitoring deer populations and their movements, a total of 50 cameras were deployed along established migration routes within the forest. These cameras were programmed to capture a sequence of ten images over a span of ten seconds whenever motion was detected, continuing this process until no further movement was observed. 

Following the retrieval of the cameras, the collected data was uploaded to Wildlife Insights, a platform that leverages artificial intelligence to initially categorize the species captured in the images. To ensure the accuracy of species identification, manual verification and correction by trained personnel were subsequently carried out, amending any misclassifications as necessary. This methodological approach provided a comprehensive and accurate assessment of the wildlife within Duke Forest.

The data set was chosen due to Katie Tack's position as an assistant to Dr. Sarah Roberts. It is not yet publicly available and was given to our team directly by Dr. Roberts.

# Data Wrangling

In this study, a meticulous data wrangling process was employed to refine and optimize the dataset for analysis. Initially, the data underwent a mutation process, wherein superfluous information was systematically filtered out, ensuring that only pertinent data elements were retained. This step was crucial for enhancing the quality and relevance of the dataset, thereby facilitating more accurate and focused analyses. Following this, the streamlined data was strategically merged with an additional dataset containing geographic coordinates. This integration was instrumental in enriching the dataset with spatial context, allowing for more comprehensive and nuanced interpretations of the data, particularly in analyses that required geographic or locational insights. The combination of these data wrangling techniques significantly improved the dataset’s utility for the research objectives, demonstrating the importance of effective data management in the extraction of meaningful insights from complex datasets.

# Analysis
We are trying to determine if time of day has any effect on when deer are seen in the Duke Forest
Could also run a multi-linear regression to determine if deer presence is dependent on both time of day and temperature. (Could obtain temperature data from the US Forest Service)

```{r Statistcal Tests, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}

deer_data <- deer_data %>% mutate(Time = start_time) %>% arrange(Time)


ggplot(deer_data, aes(Time, group_size)) + geom_point() + theme_classic() + labs(x = "Time Recorded", y = "Group Size")



first_day <- day(first(deer_data$Date))
first_month <- month(first(deer_data$Date))
deer_ts <- ts(deer_data$group_size, start = c(first_month, first_day), frequency = 31)
full_decomp <- stl(deer_ts,s.window = "periodic")
plot(full_decomp)
deer_trend <- Kendall::SeasonalMannKendall(deer_ts)

#tau = -0.101, 2-sided pvalue = 0.00060103

#Seperate Months

#Looking at the data to determine which statistcal tests to run
ggplot(deer_data_march, aes(start_time, group_size)) + geom_point() + theme_classic() + labs(x = "Time Seen on Camera Trap", y = "Size of Group Seen")

#There seems to be some kind of time series with deer in a group greater than two. 
#Since it seems like 1 group is a large amount of the data, maybe we remove those and 
#see if there is a time relationship
march_biggroups <- deer_data_march %>% filter(group_size >= 2)
ggplot(march_biggroups, aes(start_time, group_size)) + geom_point() + theme_classic() + labs(x = "Time Seen on Camera Trap", y = "Size of Group Seen")

#maybe there is a relationship - lets check another month to see if it is just March 
ggplot(deer_data_april, aes(start_time, group_size)) + geom_point() + theme_classic() + labs(x = "Time Seen on Camera Trap", y = "Size of Group Seen")

#not sure where to go from here, the plots don't necessarily suggest any relationship between group size and time seen. 
#could look just at the april data, as it seems like there is the most observations from then (almost half the observations were recorded in april)

#time series for april, group size by day
f_day <- day(first(deer_data_april$start_date))
f_month <- month(first(deer_data_april$start_date))
april_ts <- ts(deer_data_april$group_size, start = c(f_month, f_day), frequency = 31)

# Run SMK test
april_trend <- Kendall::SeasonalMannKendall(april_ts)
april_trend 
#tau = 0.0102, 2-sided p-value = 0.80434

#where to go from here: look at the other two months worth of data (could be a problem, may not have enough observations)
#potentially bring in weather data to see if temperature plays a role in how active the deer population is in the Duke Forest: https://wrcc.dri.edu/cgi-bin/rawMAIN.pl?laNDUK
