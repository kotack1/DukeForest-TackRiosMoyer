# Tracking White-Tailed Deer Movement Patterns in the Duke Forest using Camera Traps

## Summary

**Repository Summary**  
This repository was created to house the final Environmental Data Analysis project for Katie Tack, Ale Rios, Grace Randall, and Sophie Moyer. Their project focuses on white-tailed deer in the Duke Forest (Durham, Blackwood, and Korstian divisions)

**Data Collection**  
The data was collected through the lab of Dr. Sarah Roberts, whose team (including Katie Tack) placed camera traps along known migration paths. The information collected includes common_name, deployment_id, start_date, start_time, end_date, end_time, cam_id, and group_size. There is another file that contains the longitude and latitude for each camera (deployment_id).

**Project Goals**  
The analysis goals of this project are to determine the movements of white-tailed deer in the Duke Forest based on time of day and moon phase.
